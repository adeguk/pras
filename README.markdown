That's Bonfire's goal: provide a solid base off of which to build your new web applications. It's not a CMS. Instead, it's a springboard to build off of with many of the tools you wish you had on projects but never took the time to build.

All wrapped up in an elegant interface that will make you proud when you hand the project over to your client.
The students may or may not have prior experience using such system. Ideally, any student can identify him/herself to the system, to do the following:

1. Register, Add, or Drop course/courses during the registration period.
2. Pay registration fees Online through a secured web access.
